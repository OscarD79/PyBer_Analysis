# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

Pyber, a transportation service, is seeking to learn which types of fares (suburban, urban, or rural) are the most profitable. In order to find this information, one would need to create a DataFrame to summarize the average fares per ride and average fares per driver in each type. The next step in the analysis is to create a visualization based on the DataFrame.

## Results

In conclusion the rural routes offered the highest average profits per ride and per driver. However, those were the lowest overall rides and overall earnings. As can be expected, there are more than twelve times more rides offered in urban areas than rural and almost three times as many rides offered in urban areas than suburban. With this information one can infer that the bulk of the business is grouped in the type of business that offers the lowest average fares.

## Summary

Based on the findings of the Analysis, I have three potential recommendations to the CEO of PyBer.
1.	Increase rides in rural areas using a marketing campaign or offering additional incentives to rural based clients.
2. 	Add a nominal fee for trips under a certain amount of miles to offset the lower fares of urban based clients.
3. 	Offer a ride sharing wherein a person could pay a decreased amount so long as he shares a ride with a stranger, this would increase the profitability per ride.
